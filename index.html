                    <h3>About Us</h3>
                    <p>Camfinancials has been helping families improve their financial lives since 2004 and was created to help people achieve and exceed their financial goals. We subscribe to the old adage that "a penny saved is a penny earned".<br> 
                    The tax laws are written for all tax payers, therefore, all of us are entitled to various tax incentives made possible by the United States Congress.<br> 
                    We prepare taxes for our clients and we also provide the necessary education needed as it relates to tax planning and liabilities. Most people don't plan to fail, they simply fail to plan. This lack of planning often leads to an unexpected tax bill.<br>
                    The average person pays more than 30 percent of their income in taxes, some pay as much as 45 percentage! We empower our clients with the knowledge vital to ensure they are paying their fair share of taxes. Our one-on-one interview with our clients generally reveal deductions they did not realize were available to them.<br>
                    It is not how much money you make; it's what you keep. Camfinancials will help you keep more of your hard-earned dollars.</p>
